# Simple Training Plan App

## Description
The goal of this app is to create a simple training app where I can read the JSON data provided in the data directory. It would create for me a plan in the calendar for the whole week with exercises, with maybe a simple timer as well, where I can start my training, I can mark the exercise as completed, I can start a timer for the training and for the break, and where I can see the YouTube video in the exercise. Where I can mark the whole session as completed, where I can modify maybe exercise or skip or delete from the session, so it's a simple, really simple thing using Swift data and storing all information locally on my phone.
